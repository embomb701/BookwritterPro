"""In-memory event broker for the write-job SSE stream.

The pipeline runs in a background daemon thread and emits structured ``on_event``
dicts. Those are published here from the worker thread; SSE subscribers (async
generators on the event loop) drain per-subscriber ``asyncio.Queue`` objects.

Design points the API contract requires:
  * per-book bounded ring buffer so *late subscribers* replay everything emitted
    for the current/last job, then tail live events;
  * thread-safe publish: the worker thread never touches asyncio objects directly
    — it hands each event to the loop via ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe``;
  * running-job tracking so the API can return 409 when a job is already active.

Each event stream is terminated by a sentinel ``{"type": "done"}`` (or
``{"type": "error", "message": ...}``); the broker records that the book's job
has finished but keeps the ring buffer so a viewer arriving afterwards still sees
the full last run.
